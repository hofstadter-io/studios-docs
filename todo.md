# TODO

for docs rewrite, update the dates on pages that are edited

### General comments

Add some images / videos (links)

diagrams for workflows, user with some sort of glimpse into the backend sequencing 



### Getting started

- current first 3, compress to one page
- Correct example for user, switch to post, comment for types
- First [change -> example]
- expand where to next
- put features overview / list somewhere

### Studios Basics

Make sure a starting application needs minimal config change,
then move the config section closer to the end.

Get to the meat early on

Separate fields from the User page,
ought to be able to make a good pass on the User page (that won't need updating for a while)
(Pull profile from user, put somewhere else until it's separated into a first-class type in the designs)

Add a section for functions

Pages & Components

Section for DB Migrations
