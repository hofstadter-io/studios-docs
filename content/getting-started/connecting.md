The `hof` CLI requires a configuration file to
connect with the __Hofstadter Studios__ servers.

```
hof config set-context <context-name> <username> <apikey>
```

- `context-name` can be anything
- `username` is your username
- `apikey` can be found in your [profile](https://studios.studios.live.hofstadter.io/profile)


You can verify your configuration with:

```
hof config test
```
