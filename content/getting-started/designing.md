### Overview

At the root of your application,
you will see a very important
directory named `design`.
This is the "design" of your application.
You will see a number of files here,
for configuring the app features,
as well as a `modules` directory,
where your modules will go.

The rest of the files
```
app-dir/
  design/        # Main application design
  design-vendor/ # Imported modules' design

  pages/         # for page content and layouts
  translations/  # and multilingual assets
  seeds/         # application seed data
  secrets/       # for application secrets

  # not used yet
  custom/        # for custom UI components
  funcs/         # for serverless functions
```
